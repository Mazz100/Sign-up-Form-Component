### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

I learned in this project:
- using only `value.trim()` to check for empty field is enough to validate both empty and trimmed spaces.
- Can make life easier to have extra div wrapping depending on layout needs, combining two separate div for example.


### Continued development
In future project I want to simplify my process and not over complicating any implementation required for a logic.
